# Current database schema (agent-first guide)

This guide describes the **current** ShiDao database model.

## Read order for DB tasks

1. `docs/database/current-schema.md` (this file)
2. `supabase/schema/current-schema.sql`
3. `supabase/migrations/*` (only when historical/compat analysis is needed)

## Core entities (current model)

### Identity and school scope

- `parent` — parent profile linked to `auth.users`.
- `teacher` — teacher profile linked to `auth.users`.
- `school` — school/org container (`kind = personal | organization`, owner, teacher limit, demo plan fields).
- `school_teacher` — teacher membership in school (`owner | teacher`).
- `class` — group inside school, with immutable `methodology_id` after creation.
- `class_teacher` — teacher assignment to class.
- `student` — learner profile (`login`, `internal_auth_email`, optional linked `auth.users` row, optional `parent_id`).
- `class_student` — student membership in class.

### User preference and security

- `user_preference` — `last_active_profile`, selected school, theme/settings.
- `user_security` — PIN hash + lock/attempt metadata.

### Methodology source layer

- `methodology`
- `methodology_lesson`
- `reusable_asset`
- `methodology_lesson_block`
- `methodology_lesson_block_asset`
- `methodology_lesson_student_content`
- `methodology_lesson_student_content` currently represents learner-facing source-layer lesson content; future live sync/telemetry may require additional runtime fields/tables (not part of this documentation-only task).

### Runtime lesson + homework + communication

- `scheduled_lesson` — runtime lesson instance bound to class + source lesson.
- `methodology_lesson_homework` — canonical homework attached to source lesson.
- `scheduled_lesson_homework_assignment` — issued homework for a runtime lesson.
- `student_homework_assignment` — per-student status/submission/review.
- `group_student_conversation` — continuous class+student communication channel.
- `group_student_message` — messages with optional lesson/homework context links.
- `lesson_group_conversation` — one shared chat thread per scheduled lesson.
- `lesson_group_message` — lesson-scoped group chat messages (teacher/student authorship).
- `notification` — in-app runtime notifications with read/unread state for teacher/parent/student recipients.

## Key invariants

- `class.methodology_id` is required on insert and immutable after group creation (legacy rows may still be null).
- `scheduled_lesson` enforces online/offline format constraints (`meeting_link` vs `place`).
- `scheduled_lesson` runtime live-step state uses `runtime_current_step_id` + fallback `runtime_current_step_order`, plus lock/timestamps (`runtime_student_navigation_locked`, `runtime_step_updated_at`, `runtime_started_at`, `runtime_completed_at`).
- `methodology_lesson_homework.kind` supports `practice_text | quiz_single_choice`.
- `reusable_asset.kind` supports legacy + semantic kinds: `video | song | worksheet | vocabulary_set | activity_template | media_file | presentation | flashcards_pdf | lesson_video | worksheet_pdf | song_audio | song_video | pronunciation_audio`.
- `student.login` and `student.internal_auth_email` are unique.
- `school.kind = 'personal'` is the personal teacher workspace (shown as `Лично` in UI).
- `school.kind = 'organization'` is a real school/org (shown as `Школа` in UI).
- `user_preference.last_selected_school_id` stores selected organization; `null` means personal mode.

## Demo organization behavior (MVP)

- Teacher always has a personal workspace and lands in personal mode by default.
- Creating a school creates `school.kind = 'organization'` + `school_teacher(role='owner')`.
- Demo invite flow is immediate membership add for existing users (no pending invite yet).
- If email is not registered, API returns a validation message and does not create pending invitation rows.
- TODO (future): pending invite + in-app/email/Telegram notification + explicit accept before activation.

## Source-of-truth distinctions

- **Source layer:** methodology tables (`methodology*`, `reusable_asset`).
- **Runtime layer:** scheduled lessons, homework assignments, communication.
- App behavior depends on this distinction (read-only source content + mutable runtime execution data).

## Auth/profile model (current)

- Adult identity is split into explicit profile tables (`teacher`, `parent`) tied to `auth.users`.
- Student can authenticate via internal login mapping (`student.internal_auth_email`) and may also have `student.user_id` when linked.
- Current helper functions used by RLS/queries include `current_teacher_id`, `current_parent_id`, `current_student_id`.

## Compatibility / legacy notes

- Migration chain contains legacy transitions (`adult/adult_role` epoch, organization->school refactor).
- Some old migrations contain bootstrap/content inserts; they are preserved intentionally for upgrade safety.
- Snapshot files describe **current state** and should be preferred for day-to-day schema reasoning.

## When to consult migrations anyway

Use `supabase/migrations/*` when you need:

- to write a new migration,
- to understand legacy behavior/backfills,
- to debug migration order/idempotency,
- to evaluate rollback/reset behavior,
- to confirm historical introduction/removal of constraints/functions.

## Snapshot refresh workflow

Preferred (if DB access + pg_dump are available):

```bash
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://...' npm run db:snapshot
```

If not available in your environment:

- update `supabase/schema/current-schema.sql` manually based on latest applied migrations,
- call out manual refresh in PR notes,
- do **not** rewrite migration history.
